# RL implementations 

Simple implementations of RL algorithms in tensorflow or numpy. 
Note: Used numpy for ARS because it was quicker. 
Still some clean up work to do. 
Also additionally, there is a linear regression model, which I found useful to build an understanding of tensorflow. 

The requirements.txt states tensorflow not tensorflow-gpu. 
So if you want to use tensorflow-gpu please install that. 

### TODO

- Document everything
- Normalisation for ARS. 
- Baseline for REINFORCE. 
- DQN variants. 
- PPO.
